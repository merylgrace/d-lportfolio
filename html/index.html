            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                Hi there! We are D and L, web developers based in the Philippines.
                We are passionate about creating websites for a cause, and we love helping Non-Government Organizations
                focused on animal welfare.
            </p>

            <p>
                With a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from Northern Bukidnon State College, we bring two
                years and three months of experience in web development (including our undergraduate experience).
                Our goal is not only to create websites for a living but also for a meaningful cause.
            </p>

            <p>
                When we're not coding, you'll find us doing charity works on animal welfare, reading books and
                traveling.
                Let's connect and explore the possibilities together!
            </p>
